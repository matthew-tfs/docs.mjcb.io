This site is a companion website to my main website ([mjcb.io](https://mjcb.io/)) and is used strictly for posting any technical guides or documents that I have created.

This site may host guides, documentation or notes on existing projects that I am working on.

Documentation that I have created over the years will be gradually migrated to this website as I get time to do so.

{{< hint type=note title="Website Content" >}}
The content on this website can change at any time. I will make as much effort as possible to preserve the URL structure of this website, but it can change without warning. The website content is publicly available through GitHub.
